# Zero-True OpenF1 Repository

üöÄ **Had an amazing experience participating in the KAINOS: AI National Hackathon** from **Sept 26-29, 2024**, hosted by **ACM SIGAI** in collaboration with **Zero True**.

During the hackathon, I worked on analyzing Formula 1 data using the **OpenF1 API**, focusing on performance metrics from teams like **Red Bull Racing** and others. I extracted key data such as lap times, pit stops, weather conditions, and more. Using **Zero True‚Äôs Code Editor**, I cleaned and processed the data for deeper insights.

It was both fun and challenging to dive into this real-time data and uncover insights that could influence race strategies! üèéÔ∏èüìä

### Key Contributions:
- **Max Speed Analysis**: I created a max speed analysis chart to visualize the performance of various teams.
- **Data Processing**: Used **Zero True‚Äôs Code Editor** for cleaning and processing the data.
- **Code Snippets**: The repository also contains some code snippets in image format to show how the data was processed and analyzed.

A huge thanks to the organizers and everyone involved! If you're interested, check out **Zero True‚Äôs Code Editor** to get started on your own projects.

## Files Included:
- CSV files containing Formula 1 race data.
- Images of charts and code snippets related to data analysis.

Feel free to explore the data and use it for further analysis or development.
